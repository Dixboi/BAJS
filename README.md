# DATA SCIENCE JOB SIMULATION by BRITISH AIRWAYS from THE FORAGE
A collection of files from the British Airways Job Simulation

## Scenario
Bristish Airlines is interested about their customers' reviews and also about their booking purchases.

## Tasks
As the data scientist of the team, they wanted me to analyze their data with regards to reviews and booking purchases.
### Task 1
Analyze customer reviews based from the [https://www.airlinequality.com]() website.
### Task 2
Predict from the customer's data whether they will complete a booking purchase or not.

## Action
By using webscraping tools, I got the review data from the website and analyze them using NLP techniques. As for the other task, the data was already prepared so I just needed to apply machine learning models to it.

## Results
These are my findings and what happened
### Task 1
I found out that 51% of reviews says something positive about the airline while 49% says something negative. The most common words are good, best, worse, and worst.
### Task 2
I compared three machine learning models for classification and the one with the best performance is Random Forest Classifier.
